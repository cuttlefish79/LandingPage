# Landing Page

Good morning, afternoon, or even evening - depending on your timezone. This project is a little more advanced than the Odin Recipes one. Like the title says, it's a landing page containing a navigation, a header, a couple of elements which could be products, an awe inspiring quote, a call-to-action, and a basic footer. I deviated from the original design, so I hope it looks good. :)
